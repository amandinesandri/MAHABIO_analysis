Strategy:
 L-INS-i (Probably most accurate, very slow)
 Iterative refinement method (<16) with LOCAL pairwise alignment information

If unsure which option to use, try 'mafft --auto input > output'.
For more information, see 'mafft --help', 'mafft --man' and the mafft page.

The default gap scoring scheme has been changed in version 7.110 (2013 Oct).
It tends to insert more gaps into gap-rich regions than previous versions.
To disable this change, add the --leavegappyregion option.
